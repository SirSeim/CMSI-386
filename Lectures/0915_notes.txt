Homework 1: I'm still accepting late submissions until Wednesday at
midnight, so we'll discuss homework 1 Thursday. Solutions Thursday
too.

Remember:
 - start homeworks early.
 - email me if you are confused or stuck.
 - if you can't come to my scheduled office hours, you can make an
   appointment for another time.
 - would it be better if I held office hours in Keck lab? 

This class is challenging. Learning a new programming paradigm is like
learning to program for the first time again. Have to get used to
thinking about computation in new ways.

This class should also be fun. Come to me if you're frustrated.

Stop me during class if I'm not making sense. If you're confused,
you're probably not the only one. Either way, the entire class will
benefit from your question.

ocaml foo.ml  (* runs foo.ml, and exits. should have used this for hw1. *)
ocaml (* opens repl *)
